## What people say

### "Most flexibility, lowest trust assumptions"

Walletbeat uses Omnipin to deploy to IPFS. It was selected after [contrasting it against many other web3 deployment options](https://github.com/walletbeat/walletbeat/blob/beta/governance/decisions/2025-walletbeat-hosting.md), and Omnipin stood out as the one with the most flexibility, user control, lowest trust assumptions, lowest-dependency, and not locked into any specific provider.

Omnipin makes it easy to automate deployment to multiple IPFS providers for redundancy, gate deployment success by actual replication and availability on popular IPFS gateways for reliability, and to update the onchain ENS records to point to the deployed IPFS CID to boot (without granting CI any authority beyond ENS record updates). Runs great with Helios too.

In other words, Omnipin is the missing deployment tool that makes it feasible to adopt the cypherpunk standards and technologies that web3 frontends should strive to adopt. No more excuses now.
